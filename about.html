        <h2>A brief history of Jeff Carter</h2>
        <h3>
          I've actually only been in Tulsa for one month! However, it's not my first stint here!
        </h3>
        <p>
          I was born in Lubbock, TX, where I resided until I graduated from Texas Tech University. My first job after graduation was with a subsidiary of Bank of Oklahoma called Cavanal Hill Investment Management, where I researched stocks. Entering that profession, I already had an affinity for spreadsheets, but in my time there as an analyst, I trained myself in VBA for Excel so that we could automate many of our frequent tasks. I lived and worked in Tulsa for 6.5 years until I moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in DFW, I began working for an attorney with whom I still work today. Soon after joining the firm, I realized there was so much I could do to improve the ways we stored and used information, which was primarily stored in Google Sheets. I realized there were so many processes that could be automated if only I knew Google Apps Script (a language closely based on JavaScript). I taught myself JavaScript using an amazing e-book called <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent JavaScript</a>. I then wrote a whole software layer on top of Google Sheets, fulfilling the vision of automating and augmenting our work processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my work with the attorney, you could say the floodgates were opened!! I found MANY other uses for programming languages. I actually started with the back-end first. The datasets I had been analyzing in Excel grew too large for spreadsheets, so I moved on to databases and MySQL. I quickly realized the power of PHP to communicate with my databases and Python to analyze the data. Then I learned HTML and CSS in order to be able to build the front-end for websites. Finally, I added in the JavaScript I had learned earlier to the mix to make the end user experience more dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I have utilized my coding skills in my jobs, my many personal projects and websites, and even one paid commercial website, I have felt that my skills just weren't improving at quite the pace necessary to become employed as a software engineer. I began considering pursuing formal education in CS/software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Late in 2020, a friend of mine in DFW was accepted into the Tulsa Remote program, and she and her husband moved here. She spent months coaxing me to follow them here, and in June 2021, her efforts succeeded. I moved back on July 9th after 6.5 years in Texas. Less than a week after arriving, I just happened to meet a Holberton employee around town, asked her what she did for a living, and --what do you know-- I started my application the very next day! <span class="p_bold_italic">It feels like serendipity!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am looking to pursue the intersections of computer science, finance, economics, and even art.
        </p>
