    <h1>Serendipity</h1>
    <h2>Perhaps the start of a new chapter?</h2>
    <p>
      I feel that it is serendipity that I am sitting here working on this application to Holberton School at this moment.
    </p>
    <h3>What is serendipity?</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 10px; font-style: italic;">
      Oxford defines serendipity as <code>"the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way."</code>
    </p>
    <h2>An unlikely fortunate occurence</h2>

      Just feeling like I needed a change to shake things up, I moved to Tulsa on July 9, 2021 and moved in with a roommate I had never met before. He seemed like a nice enough fellow, but I decided to join him at the Mercury Lounge to get to know him a little better.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our discussion, the topic of coincidences emerged. I mentioned that a book called the Celestine Prophecy has had a significant meaningful impact on my life. I explained that the book had a very new-agey explanation for why we should pay attention to coincidences, and while I didn't buy into the woo-woo explanation, I did find the central idea of paying attention to coincides important.

    <p>
      I continued that if we noticed it <strong><em>as</em></strong> a coincidence then it must have caught our attention <strong><em>for some reason</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately as I had completed that thought a couple walked up and begin speaking to my roommate asking about his Tulsa Remote t-shirt. We began chatting with them, and I learned that the woman works at a software engineering school called Holberton.

      My ears immediately perked up, and I said, "Tell me more!" I've been programming as a solo amateur for around 13 years. I've even incorporated it into my career, but I've always entertained the idea of making the pivot to code full-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she described the program, I couldn't believe the fact that such a coincidence happened almost immediately after we had been discussing the importance of paying attention to coincidences. I definitely felt like the universe (or perhaps my own subconscious) was telling me something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long story short, after an email or two and a phone conversation, I began my application. I am so excited to see where this path may lead!
