        <h1>Serendipity</h1>
        <h2>Perhaps the start of a new chapter?</h2>
        <p>
          I feel that it is serendipity that I am sitting here working on this application to Holberton School at this moment.

          <h3>What is serendipity?</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;">
            Oxford defines serendipity as <code>"the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way."</code>
          </p>

        <h2>An unlikely but fortunate occurence</h2>

          Just feeling like I needed a change to shake things up, I moved to Tulsa on July 9, 2021 and moved in with a roommate I had never met before. He seemed like a nice enough fellow, but I decided to join him at the Mercury Lounge to get to know him a little better.
        </p>
        <p>
          During our discussion, the topic of coincidences emerged. I mentioned that a book called the Celestine Prophecy has had a significant meaningful impact on my life. I explained that the book had a very new-agey explanation for why we should pay attention to coincidences. While I didn't buy into the woo-woo explanation, I did find the book's central idea of paying attention to coincides important.
        </p>

        <p>
          I continued that if we noticed it <strong><em>AS</em></strong> a coincidence then it must have an importance to us. It caught our attention <strong><em>for SOME reason</em></strong>. The reason may not be known to our consciousness, but it is very likely known to our subconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost immediately as I had completed that thought a couple walked up and begin speaking to my roommate asking about his Tulsa Remote t-shirt. That was the first coincidence. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My roommate is not a part of Tulsa Remote, but he's friends with quite a few who are. Yet he happened to be wearing that t-shirt that night, and it turns out the man works for Tulsa Remote.
        </p>
        <p>
          We began chatting with the couple. While my roommate was discussing Tulsa Remote, I asked the woman what she does for a living. She told me that she works for a software engineering school here in Tulsa called Holberton. That was the second coincidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ears immediately perked up, and I said, "Tell me more!" You see, I've been programming as a solo amateur for around 13 years. I've even incorporated it into my career, but I've always entertained the idea of making the pivot to coding full-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she described the program, I couldn't believe the fact that these coincidences happened almost immediately after my roommate and I had been discussing the importance of paying attention to coincidences. I definitely felt like the universe (or perhaps my own subconscious) was telling me something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long story short, after an email or two and a phone conversation, I began my application. I am so excited to see where this path will lead!
