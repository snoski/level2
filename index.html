      <h1>Serendipity</h1>
      <h2>Perhaps the start of a new chapter?</h2>
      <p>
        I feel that it is serendipity that I am sitting here working on this application to Holberton School at this moment.

      <h3>What is serendipity?</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 10px; font-style: italic;">
        Oxford defines serendipity as "the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way."
      </p>
      <h2>An unlikely fortunate occurance</h2>

        I moved to Tulsa on July 9, 2021 and moved in with a roommate I had never met before. He seemed like a nice enough fellow, but I decided to join him at the Mercury Lounge to get to know him a little better.

        During our visit, the topic of coincidences emerged. I mentioned that a book called the Celestine Prophecy has had a significant meaningful impact on my life. I explained that the book had a very new-agey explanation for why we should pay attention to coincidences, and while I didn't buy into the woo-woo explanation, I did find the central idea of paying attention to coincides important.

      <p>
        I continued that if we noticed it <strong><em>as</em></strong> a coincidence then it must have caught our attention <strong><em>for some reason</em></strong>.

        Almost immediately as I had completed that thought a couple walked up and begin speaking to my roommate asking about his Tulsa Remote t-shirt. We began chatting with them, and I learned that the woman works at a software engineering school called Holberton.

        My ears immediately perked up, and I said, "Tell me more!" I've been programming as a solo amateur for around 13 years. I've even incorporated it into my career, but I've always entertained the idea of making the pivot to code full-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long story short, after an email or two and a phone conversation, I began my application. I am so excited to see where this path may lead!
