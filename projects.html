        <h1>Other stuff I've worked on!</h1>
        <h2>My personal website: <a href="http://jeffbcarter.com">jeffbcarter.com</a></h2>
        <a href="http://jeffbcarter.com"><img src="http://jeffbcarter.com/Monthly%20Returns/jeffbcarter.png" class="medium" alt="personal website"></a>
        <p>
          It's a little cheesy, and it needs to be updated, but hey! It's mine and I love it. ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
        <p>
          My plan for its future is to migrate it to a better server where I can do more back-end stuff. Currently it is hosted from GitHub pages, so I can only serve static content right now. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One cool thing I did was I found a way (despite it being a static site) to design it so that I only have to update my navbar in one place, and it populates the changes across all of my pages.
        </p>
        <h2>DrivrTrackr</h2>
        <img src="http://jeffbcarter.com/Monthly%20Returns/drivrtrackr.png" class="medium" alt="drivrtrackr">
        <p>
          For a while, I was part of a group in DFW that recruited Uber drivers to also drive for Lyft. To recruit a driver, we would take a ride on Uber and then try to explain to that driver the benefits of driving for both platforms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It was fun and sometimes lucrative gig, but there were lots of inefficiencies like you oftentimes get the same drivers you already signed up, or you forgot that lead's name or number, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed this website basically as a mobile CRM to help me keep track of all of the drivers I was riding with to drive greater efficiency, and I eventually expanded it to additional users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, this recruiting program came to an end, so I ceased development on the website, but I learned SO MUCH in the process of creating it.
        </p>
        <h2>My <a href="http://jeffbcarter.com/blog.html">takedown</a> of a flat earth video</h2>
        <img src="http://jeffbcarter.com/projects/earth/roundearthdiagram.png" class="medium" alt="the earth is round">
        <p>
          My favorite parts of this was figuring out and explaining all of the math first in my <a href="http://jeffbcarter.com/blog.html">blog</a> then creating an <a href="http://jeffbcarter.com/projects/earth/roundearth.html">AWESOME JavaScript animation</a> to illustrate those points. (If you are interested, I'd highly recommend reading the blog post about it before watching the animation so that you understand what you're looking at. Also, you might need to run the animation 2 or 3 times. It's always jittery at first.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I could improve this animation by loading all of the pictures onto the page (but hidden from view) before the user clicks to start the animation. This should make the animation less jittery the first time it is run.
        </p>
        <h2>My <a href="http://jeffbcarter.com/projects/MMSimulator/MMHome.html">March Madness</a> simulations</h2>
        <img src="http://jeffbcarter.com/projects/MMSimulator/homebracket.png" class="medium" alt="March Madness Simulator">
        <p>
          I started this project mainly to help me fill out March Madness brackets. ESPN allows each person to fill out up to 25 brackets. That is SO MANY to fill out with "intelligent randomness." If you're trying to do it yourself, even if you're trying to inject variety into it, you're going to wind up with a lot of biases in your picks.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I created a probabilistic model and wrote a program in VBA to build my brackets for me, and I just fill in the 25 brackets that my program churns out. But then I thought, "Well, heck, I've got a program that gives me 25 brackets, why not, while we're at it, do 100,000 and analyze the results and publish them online?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly, I tended to get bored with these simulations after Texas Tech was eliminated and/or after most of my brackets were wiped out (whichever came later). ðŸ˜‚ But there were definitely some interesting insights along the way!
        </p>
        <h2>There are SO MANY MORE...</h2>
